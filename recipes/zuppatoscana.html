                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

                <li>1 (32 ounce) container chicken broth</li>
                
                <li>2 cups water, or as needed</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol><li><p>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook     and  stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and garlic; sauté until onion is tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</p></li>

                Place potatoes in a slow cooker; add cooked sausage and onion mixture. Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Pour in chicken broth and up to 2 cups water to completely cover potatoes. Stir soup gently and cover.</p></li>

                <li><p>Pour in heavy cream and stir in kale to combine. Cover and cook on High until flavors are incorporated, about 30 minutes more. Garnish with Parmesan cheese.</p></li></ol>
